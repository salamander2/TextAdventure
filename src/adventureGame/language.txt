Language parser improvements
============================

1. Single words:
- any single word that is not on the list "I don't understand that command"

- quit
- exit
- i
- inventory
- n,w,s,e,u,d, north, west, south, east, up, down
- sleep
- look
- help
- walk / run  <-- just move by writing the direction
- search
- pray


2. Two words: Verb-Noun
- check to see if verb is valid
- check to see if noun goes with that verb.
- if not, then "How do you ___ that"? (how do you climb that?" "There is no NOUN here")
- now we have to run the correct method. Could use lambda? but don't know how, so large switch:

- climb tree
- read ___ (paper)
- open ___ 
- eat ____ (sandwich)
- examine _____
- lookat _____
- pickup _____
- take ____
- drop ____    drop all
- use ____
- pull _____ (lever)
- kick _____ (leaves)
- throw knife
- please help
- take all
- turn on flashlight
- switch on flashlight
- turn off flashlight (not needed)


3. Three words.
Unusual. One seems to be a direction, one seems to be a noun in the location
- climb up tree [ climb up --> climb]  
- climb down tree [climb down -> down]
- pull lever down
- pick up rock [ pick up --> take]
- reach into water [search] [search water]
- look under carpet

4. Four words: verb noun preposition noun
- first make sure both nouns are items that are present

examples:
- take emerald from chest
- put knife into chest
- put hand in water
- give A to B
- attack troll with sword [wield sword, attack troll]
- hit/smash rock with hammer
- use hammer on door
- use hammer to break rock [remove word "to"] (if there are 5 words and one is "to")
- put batteries in flashlight
- throw knife at goblin
