Version information

v2.0
DONE:
  flashlight
  treasure door
  lembas package, open, eat
  wall clue in fetid cave
  lake and key are fixed
  winning should be checked elsewhere
  change all "room" text to "location"
  smash command
  close command seems to work
  put command works (but only 1 item can go into a container)
  cut paper works: make smaller papers with words that are various colours.
  use command: hammer only. Anything else?
  throw (knife)
  goblin
  harmonized method names. Most "Object" has been changed to "Item".
  fixed put command
  
TO FIX:   
* the earthquake should make the chest appear in the treasury 
  X It's fine in the secret room, revealed by "move lever".
  But this won't work if the other lever is connected to this one.
	
* Allow containers to hold more than one item (is this necessary?).
  What happens if you put two things into one container?

* Make earthquake lever in control room on cliff. It closes the cave in a rockfall, and opens the southern forest.
  It also disables the earthquake lever in the secret room. The chest still appears (somewhere).
* Make southern forest with hole that drops you down to crystal cave. You get a crystal as a light.
 This then provides an alternate route down, along with being trapped down there since you cannot climb up again.  
 * crystal will have to also light up the room.
  

v1.8
Rewrite a lot of it.
change the clues, move a few items around
use reflection for methods

v1.7.
climb tree (climbable boolean for room == go up)

v1.6
open paper still -- done
use hammer to break rock -- done.
I need to separate the word that the user uses to identify an object in a room from the item name in the list.
e.g. A rock could be rock1, rock2, rock3, but the user would just type rock.
What about multiple keys? If there is more than one key in inventory, then need adjective, otherwise just use key

how to handle special functions yet remain general for any Adventure game program?

v 1.5
finish off map,
add items (container, activate things)
make winning conditions
need a way for things to be hidden -- e,g under a door, under leaves. 
need to be able to move things (move leaves, rocks)
get key from lake
open paper, open package 

v 1.4
change itemlist into a hashmap too.
add inventory. Inventory displays health and food status.
take and drop are working
added health and food
light, darkness, fallign into pits also work

v 1.3
change Roomlist from an array into a hashmap for easier room handling.
Moved setupRooms to Room class
items improved a lot. added some to the map.
added player, added eat function (but need to make everthing lowecase to work)


Excercise for students:
Write a method that will do both of these:


	void moveLeaves() {		
		System.out.println("You kick the leaves around. Hey, there's a shiny key in the leaves.");
		if (! roomList.get("clearning").items.contains("key"))
			roomList.get("clearing").items.add("key");		
		Item it = itemList.get("leaves");
		it.moveMethod = "";
		itemList.put("leaves", it);
		
	}	
	
	void moveDoor() {
		System.out.println("With great effort you move the door a few inches.\n"
				+ "You see a small package under the door.");
		//check if package is already in room:
		if (! roomList.get("treasury").items.contains("package"))
			roomList.get("treasury").items.add("package");
		//stop door from being moved again.
		Item it = itemList.get("door");
		it.moveMethod = "";
		itemList.put("door", it);
	}
